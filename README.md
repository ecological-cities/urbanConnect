# urbanConnect
Connectivity in urban areas


connectivity_1.sh create raster maps with increasing buffer width for the overall vegetation, shrub, tree and grass layers in tree towns (Bedford, Luton, Milton Keynes). Then it computes the density of gardens for each layer and towns.

connectivity_2.py computes the Landscape division index (probability 2 random points in the landscape are connected) for each buffer map previously created.

connectivity_3.sh prepare data to be imported in R

connectivity_4.R plot data (Landsace division vs buffer size)
